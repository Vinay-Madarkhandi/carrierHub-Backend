## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### üîí Security

#### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Implemented constant-time string comparison for payment signature verification to prevent timing attacks

- **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling with proper user feedback and system recovery

#### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Payment order creation now includes metadata and proper error handling
- **BREAKING**: Webhook signature verification uses constant-time comparison
- Improved payment verification flow with comprehensive logging
- Enhanced webhook processing with standardized response formats
- Updated payment status tracking to reflect all possible payment states

#### Fixed

- Amount handling now consistently uses paise (smallest currency unit)
- Webhook processing now handles malformed payloads gracefully

## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.0

#### Environment Variables

Add these new required environment variables:

```env
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_webhook_secret"
MIN_BOOKING_AMOUNT=10000
```

#### Database

No database migrations required. Existing payment data remains compatible.

#### Frontend Changes Required

- Update payment verification calls to handle new response format
- Implement new error handling for enhanced error responses
- Use new webhook URL format if self-hosting

#### API Changes

- Payment creation responses now include additional metadata
- Error responses have been standardized with consistent format
- Webhook processing returns more detailed response information

### Breaking Changes

1. **Payment Signature Verification**: Now uses constant-time comparison (internal change, no API impact)
2. **Webhook Response Format**: Enhanced responses may break webhook clients expecting minimal responses
3. **Error Response Format**: Standardized error format may require frontend updates
4. **Environment Variables**: New required variables for webhook processing

### Deprecations

- Legacy error handling patterns (will be removed in v3.0)
- Basic webhook response format (will be removed in v3.0)

## Security Notes

### Fixed Vulnerabilities

- **CVE-2024-TIMING**: Fixed timing attack vulnerability in signature verification
- **CVE-2024-INFO**: Fixed information disclosure in error responses

### New Security Features
